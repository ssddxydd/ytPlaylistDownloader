Youtube Download Script in scala
My attempt at creating a youtube download script in scala while also playing around with mill to get comfortable.
There's quite few dependencies like ffmpeg and youtube-dl which will need to be installed for all this to work correctly on your system.
Also please do not judge my music taste if you find the playlist. Thanks x
